Penelope

A1a
I would sit still and gather moss on stone
I would barter my crown to fill warm throne
I would suck marrow from the still-warm bone
I would touch weathered flesh with skin of crone
I would kiss every shadow winds have blown

 
A1b
I would sit a vigil at Hades’ door
I would slit the throat of our finest boar
I would rail and wail against senseless war
I would swim across fetid pool of gore
I would stare for hours at an empty shore

 
B1a
In horror each night I watch as you drown
In our fields neglected crops wither brown
In wispy clouds’ whisper, I dream you down
In time you fall, a fool, a shawl, a crown
In mocking tone they take you for a clown

 
B1b
In clear lucid night you rise naked, wet
In fulfilment of a prophetic bet
In every hour, a reason to regret
In simple handiwork, memories forget
In weak moments my appetites would whet

 
A2a
I would fingers touch, I would sigh and moan
I would you here to see how he has grown
I would you had not left us all alone
I would have your skin, sinews to me sewn
I would your heart, your eyes, your neck, backbone

 
A2b
I would pry your wrecked ship from ocean floor
I would shed all these visions I deplore
I would render tame a restless centaur
I would shatter the mirror of your whore
I would commit crimes, do things I abhor

 
B2a
My house of wax is slowly melting down
My thighs quiver in a threadbare nightgown
My glass reflects worry near to breakdown
My eyes in dirt, they would have me facedown
My offerings spent, coffers upside-down

 
B2b
My toils spent paying your insolvent debt
My fingers cut on threads of empty net
My future predestined, a fracture set
My man will be another woman’s pet
My guards useless as I alone face threat
 
C1a
Nothing to do but throw in the towel
Nothing at table, neither fish nor fowl
Nothing but usurpers here cheek by jowl
Nothing sent here by your god or her owl
Nothing on lips that are fixed in a scowl
 

 
C1b
Nothing worse than gruesome bile thick with hate
Nothing to feed our maidens but rotting bait
Nothing for our livestock, no partners to mate
Nothing satisfying, nothing will sate
Nothing to do here, nothing but to wait

 
D1a
When the last black rhinoceros lies dead
When the last Pyrenean ibex fled
When the last Javan tiger has not bred
When all the aurochs have finally bled
When wicked hunter mounts last lion’s head

 
D1b
When skies yield no promising flocks of bird
When minks are pelted and are stripped, unfurred
When the last great cat has finally purred
When silence is my lover’s only word
When giants sleeping underground are stirred

 
C2a
Nothing left for the banshee but to howl
Nothing left where the tiger used to prowl
Nothing left of the fierce cat but its growl
Nothing tastes fresh, even the air is foul
Nothing for sacrifice, birds disembowel
 
C2b
Nothing for the cock that crowed too late
Nothing but cold headstone for bedmate
Nothing but suitors, how their insults grate
Nothing not expired far beyond its date
Nothing fertile in this abandoned state
 
D2a
If we lay down now, have we made our bed?
If I sought solitude, I’d not have wed
If dawn lights a bier, the morning I dread
If progeny ceases, our hopes we shed
If land is corrupt, our map must be shred

 
D2b
If we can’t see clearly, our vision blurred 
If we asked for blessings, gods have demurred
If justice is lacking, anger is spurred
If we seek our bliss, we find it cloistered
If you lie dead, I’d have your bones interred


 
E1a
For broken homes and bones my fingers weave
For broken bones that suffer butcher’s cleave
For every doubting night alone I grieve
For each soldier’s widow that war bereave
For species lost we will never retrieve
 
E1b
For refugees crowded on stranded boat
For swamps and bogs where hopeless bodies float
For every memory castle needs a moat
For wretched shores where broken bodies bloat
For the blood of our sacrificial goat

 
F1a
Wash away the pain from my aching hand
Wash contagion from this our poisoned land
Wash my beating heart, its blood on this sand
Wash over me golden, yearning, and tanned
Wash away this loss, our desires demand

 
F1b
Wash my hands, this blood, this permanent stain
Wash swollen joints, pricked skin, this ceaseless pain
Wash my yearning lips, wet my tongue profane
Wash imprisoned queen in the moonlight’s wane
Wash shrouded intentions and make them plain

 
E2a
All tangled in this tapestry unweave
All gods will fall as we do not believe
All the children we will never conceive
All loopholes only for a while deceive
All heroes at war seek glory naive

 
E2b
All epics, histories which fate rewrote
All endeavour whispers, nothing of note
All daggers that would slit my threatened throat
All the parasites and usurpers smote
All suitors their interests alone promote

 
F2a
Swim the seas and find solace on our strand
Swim now towards the destiny we planned
Swim as if the waves you yourself command
Swim electric rush from adrenal gland
Swim to shore, free me from my prison land

 
F2b
Swim your dark shadows in my fevered brain
Swim gossamer threads uncoiled from the skein
Swim as love drowning, driving me insane
Swim with knife in teeth, come destroy the vain
Swim as if I true to you yet remain

 
G1a
We are as threads too tangled to unwind
We are bound with chains that we can’t unbind
We share neither bed nor bread, touch nor mind
We have lost the treasures you’ll never find
We ourselves made the restraints used to bind

 
G2a
Our promised contract has never been signed
Our fragile bones against the millstone’s grind
Our paths once crossed but were never aligned
Our oracle is as mute as he is blind
Our fate is as we, to it, are resigned

 
G1b
We may only meet again in our tomb
We can’t sweep away this soil with a broom
We can never happy ending assume
We cast hopes to the wind as grey clouds loom
We clown away in a jester’s costume

 
G2b
Our cupboards empty as a barren womb
Our warp and weft we unthread on this loom
Our hopes lie in state, the ghost of my groom
Our table set for the feast to resume
Our garden bereft of flowers that bloom
